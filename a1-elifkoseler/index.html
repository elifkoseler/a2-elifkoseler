<br/>Peter Jackson and Ian McKellen as Gandalf<br/><br/>
The films are subtitled The Fellowship of the Ring (2001),
The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003).
They are a New Zealand-American venture produced by WingNut Films and The Saul Zaentz Company and distributed by New Line Cinema.
<br/><br/>
The trilogy was one of the biggest and most ambitious film projects ever undertaken.
It had a budget of $281 to <ins>$330 million </ins> depending on the source.
All three films were shot over eight years simultaneously and entirely in Jackson's native New Zealand.
One in every 160 New Zealanders was part of the production.
Each film in the series also had special extended editions released on DVD a year after their respective theatrical releases.
While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.

Set in the fictional world of Middle-earth, the films follow the hobbit <i>Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood)</i> as he and
the Fellowship embark on a quest to destroy the One Ring, and thus ensure the destruction of its maker,
the Dark Lord <i>Sauron</i>. The Fellowship eventually splits up and Frodo continues the quest together with his loyal companion <i>Sam (Sean Astin)</i> and the treacherous <i>Gollum (Andy Serkis)</i>.
Meanwhile, <i>Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen)</i>, heir in exile to the throne of <i>Gondor, Legolas, Gimli, Merry, Pippin,</i> and the wizard <i>Gandalf (Ian McKellen) </i>
unite to rally the Free Peoples of Middle-earth in the War of the Ring.
<br/><br/>
The series was received with overwhelming praise and was a major financial success, with the films collectively being among the highest-grossing film series of all time.
The films were critically acclaimed and heavily awarded, winning 17 out of 30 total <i>Academy Award</i> nominations. The final film in the series,
The Return of the King, won all 11 of its Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, which also tied it with Ben-Hur and Titanic for most Academy Awards received for a film. The series received wide praise for its innovative special and visual effects.
