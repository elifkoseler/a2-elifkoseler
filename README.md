Hello,

This is my dynamic wep page application about Lord of The Rings triology.
You can comment with signing in my website.

Unfortunately, my web page does not run on heroku even it was running on local. Heroku gave 'Aplication Error' and I runned 'heroku logs --tail' and 'heroku -a elifkoseler' on Heroku CLI, it gave 'H10' error. I searched and tried different solutions on the internet even so it did not work. I would be glad if you could help me.

If you try to run on your local computer, hope you like it.

Nevertheless, you can reach Heroku links here:
